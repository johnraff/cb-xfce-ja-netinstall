This will attempt to install the configuration files and packages
needed to build an XFCE-Openbox Crunchbang respin.
However, this is NOT an official CrunchBang install medium.
Any problems you may experience are not the responsibility of
CrunchBang, although you may possibly be able to resolve some of them
by asking other users at the CrunchBang Forums.
